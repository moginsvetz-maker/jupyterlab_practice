# jupyterlab_practice

## Assignment Criteria
The assignment focused first on understanding the Jupyter Lab, and how to create/use environments.
We also learned Markdown functions as well as keyboared shortcuts. The more difficult tasks were using the LaTex for displaying formulas in Jupyter Lab, how to explort files to HTML without through cell code, and had more practice on merging branches. 

##Issues with Pull/Merge Request
In this assignment I ran into an error where I could not see two files in my main branch after trying to merge several times. The issue was with an accidental 'revert' button click, causing both yalm and question11 files to be deleted. Upon doing my research, I was supposed to able to revert these changes but could not locate this feature. The solution relied on me manually copying the files to the main branch which is what you will see in the commit history.
